**{geocodebr}** is a package to geocode data in Brazil. It provides a simple and efficient way to geocode from addresses to spatial coordinates and to reverse-geocode from spatial coordinates to addresses. The package builds on open spatial data sets of Brazilian addresses, mainly using the National Registry of Addresses for Statistical Purposes (English for *Cadastro Nacional de Endereços para Fins Estatísticos*, CNEFE). CNEFE is
[published](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/38734-cadastro-nacional-de-enderecos-para-fins-estatisticos.html) by the Brazilian official statistics and Geography Office (IBGE) The package is currently available in R.


## Installation

The package is not yet on CRAN. You can install the development version with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ipeaGIT/geocodebr")
```

## Basic Usage

### Geocoding: from addresses to spatial coordinates

Once you have a  table (`data.frame`) with addresses, geolocating the data with **{geocodebr}** can be done in two simple steps:

1. The first step is to use the `setup_address_fields()` function to declare the names of the columns in your input `data.frame` that correspond to each field of the addresses.

2. The second step is to use the `geocode()` function to find the geographic coordinates of input addresses.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geocodebr)

# read input sample data
input_df <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/small_sample.csv", package = "geocodebr"))

# 1st step: indicate the columns describing the address fields
fields <- geocodebr::setup_address_fields(
  logradouro = "nm_logradouro",
  numero = "Numero",
  cep = "Cep",
  bairro = "Bairro",
  municipio = "nm_municipio",
  estado = "nm_uf"
  )

# 2nd step: geocode
df <- geocodebr::geocode(
  addresses_table = input_df,
  address_fields = fields,
  n_cores = 1,
  progress = FALSE
  )

```
The results of {geocodebr} are classified into six broad `precision` categories depending on how exactly each input address was matched with CNEFE data. See more information in the function documentation or in the **geocoding vignette**.


### Reverse-geocoding: from spatial coordinates to addresses

## Related projects

There are numerous geolocation packages available, many of which can be used in 
R (list below). Most of these alternatives rely on commercial software and 
data sets, often imposing strict limits on the number of free queries. In contrast, 
the main advantages of {geocodebr} are that (a) it is completely free, allowing 
unlimited queries without any cost; (b) it operates with high speed and efficient 
scalability, allowing one to geocode millions of addresses in just a few minutes
without requiring advanced or high-end computational infrastructure.
